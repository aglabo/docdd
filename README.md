# deckrd - "Your Goals to Task" framework

## About deckrd

deckrd is a **document-driven workflow for progressively documenting and organizing requirements through implementation decisions**.

It manages the following documents as separate, distinct layers:

- requirements (demands and conditions)
- decision-records (history of design decisions)
- specifications (detailed specifications)
- implementation (implementation decisions and guidelines)
- tasks (implementation tasks)

> Prerequisites: AI execution environment (Claude Code, etc.) and access to a compatible LLM

## Installation

### Using as Claude Code plugins

```bash
# Add marketplace if needed
claude plugin marketplace add aglabo/deckrd

# Install deckrd
claude plugin install deckrd@deckrd
```

### Agent Skills (codex, etc.)

1. Download the zip archive from [deckrd - release](https://github.com/aglabo/deckrd/releases)
2. Copy the `deckrd` directory to your Agent Skills directory

## Basic Usage

### Workflow

```
Goals / Ideas
    ↓
requirements (Define requirements)
    ↓
specifications (Write specifications)
    ↓
implementation (Decision criteria)
    ↓
tasks (Implementation tasks)
    ↓
Code / Tests
```

### Key Commands

| Command                     | Description                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `init <namespace>/<module>` | Prepare directories for documents  |
| `req`                       | Create requirements definition     |
| `spec`                      | Create specification document      |
| `impl`                      | Create implementation criteria     |
| `tasks`                     | Create implementation task list    |
| `dr --add`                  | Record Decision Records (optional) |
| `status`                    | Check workflow progress            |

## Important Notes

### About implementation

The implementation layer is **not a place to write actual code**.
It records the following aspects of implementation decisions:

- Rationale for choosing implementation strategies
- Decision basis when multiple options exist
- Constraints (compatibility, performance, dependencies, etc.)
- Items intentionally decided "not to implement"

### What deckrd Does NOT Do

deckrd does not aim to:

- Automatically generate code
- Enforce implementation details
- Impose a single development methodology (TDD / BDD, etc.)

deckrd is purely an **assistive framework for organizing thoughts and decisions**.

## deckrd-coder Plugin

### About deckrd-coder

`deckrd-coder` is an **optional plugin** for deckrd users.
It takes `tasks.md` generated by deckrd and automatically implements them using a strict BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) process.

**Completely optional**: You can use deckrd alone to generate tasks and implement them manually at your own pace.

### Installation

deckrd-coder is available from the deckrd marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin install deckrd-coder@deckrd
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Step 1: Plan and document with deckrd
/deckrd init myProject/feature
/deckrd req
/deckrd spec
/deckrd impl
/deckrd tasks

# Step 2: Implement automatically with deckrd-coder (optional)
/deckrd-coder T01-01    # Implement task T01-01
/deckrd-coder T01-02    # Implement task T01-02
# ... (run for each task)

# Step 3: Verify and commit
git diff
git add .
git commit
```

### Important Notes

- **Prerequisites**: deckrd's `tasks.md` is required. Run deckrd first.
- **Implementation Flow**: Automatically executes Red-Green-Refactor cycle (test → implement → refactor)
- **Quality Gates**: Automatically validates tests, linting, and type checking
- **Commit**: Execute manually (not automatic)
